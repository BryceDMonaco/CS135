# CS135
My projects for my CS135 class (Fall 2015)

Project specification and requirement sheets will be included with each project to show what
challenges needed to be overcome to meet an objective. Seeing this requirements might explain
some strange uses of functions because many projects required the C language to be used in
abstract ways to meet a simple goal.

Anything in "Misc" was not a class project, but was code that I wrote to help for other classes.
