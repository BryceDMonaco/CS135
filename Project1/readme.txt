The "convert" program required no special compile commands.

The "interest" program requires the "-lm" command when compiling (see source for compile command).

The "grade" program fufills the basic AND challenge requirements. Input any grade (any float between 0 and 100 inclusively) to have the program function normally, input "-1" for any grade to utilize the challenge function. It requires the "-std=c99" compile command.
