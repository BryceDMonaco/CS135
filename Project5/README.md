Project 5 is a special case project. I wrote the following files:
	-	make_steg.c
	-	solve_image.c
The rest of the code was provided by the class professor. Any files ending in .ppm are image files used for encoding.

The goal of this project was to hide one image in another using steganographic encoding, which involves modification of one image's bits to hide a black and white image inside its pixels. See the project specs pdf for a full breakdown of the project.
